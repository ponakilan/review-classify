FD3...,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 3, 2021","When Ocrevus first came out, it was practically touted as a ‘miracle drug,’ and it seemed like everyone with MS wanted to get on it. I had such high hopes when I read that not only did it do a great job in reducing relapses and new brain lesions, it significantly slowed progression and even dramatically improved a lot of patients’ symptoms. Well, in the almost two years I’ve been on it, all it has done for me is make my walking a heck of a lot worse. Prior to Ocrevus, I used to enjoy going on hiking trails even though I used a cane. Now I can barely hobble around my backyard. Rather than slowing down progression, it seems to have sped mine up. I fear that if I continue to stay on it, the day will come when I won’t be able to walk at all anymore. Really disappointed and disgusted by this drug.",1 / 10,negative,"• High hopes for Ocrevus due to its initial promising results

Without Ocrevus, my left leg was starting to drag, fatigue was strong, walking was harder, trouble with cognition and memory. The first day after infusion with Ocrevus, I felt a difference, almost like I don't have MS. Reading all these reviews, I wonder if there are types of MS that respond better than others.

So I can't really attest to how effective the drug will be long term. What I can attest to is that before I started it, I was really concerned. It's all too easy to read online and get worried about potentially severe side effects and infusion reactions. I figure most people don't report when nothing goes wrong. So that's what I want to do. I started my first infusion, got my premedication for which I had no side effects. The only infusion side effect I had was a slightly odd sensation in the back of my throat near the end of the infusion, which quickly went away after finishing. In my second infusion, I had no side effects whatsoever. And from then until now, I honestly wouldn't even have known I had it. I'm optimistic and very glad I didn't let my fears get the better of me.

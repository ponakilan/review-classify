What was so hard with sticking to the standard “press autoinject on your skin and then press a button” mechanism? The Plegridy autoinject pen requires you to use a stabbing mechanism into your skin, with then it automatically releases the needle and injects the medicine. Or at least that’s what is supposed to happen. I find it far more mentally taxing than any other autoinject pen that I’ve used. I wish there was another option for injecting this medication.

I was on Copaxone for 5 years and was doing great before the switch. Had I known what I know now, I would have opted for the alternative Copaxone financial assistance (a reimbursement program) to stay on the daily shot once Kaiser auto-switched patients to Glatopa (for cost-saving purposes to them) without ensuring the negative side effects to patients because basically they just don't care. All that being said, within 6 months of switching to Glatopa, I ended up in the hospital with transverse myelitis for 10 days (with a 100K hospital bill), which is more than a relapse, it's a completely new lesion on the spine. Anyway, while in the hospital, a doctor told me that a generic does not have to be exactly the same ingredients as their predecessor. She said the generic drug can contain up to 20% of new proprietary ingredients. Wish I had known. It's unbelievable that Kaiser (or any doctor) would just switch patients to a new drug without that full disclosure or before the medication has been truly tested as a genuine safe replacement. I have since been referred to the MS Center (where they don't recommend Glatopa - go figure). My new doctor (at the MS Center) put me on Tysabri - which I hear is the 'Cadillac' of current MS treatments. Anyway, been doing fine on it so far with the exception of lingering nerve discomfort from the Glatopa relapse (for which I also take Gabapentin).

For me, I haven't had any single side effects (at least yet) except for diarrhea, just a bit annoying but I hope it will go away as soon as my body adapts. Occasionally I feel like my scalp feels a bit hot, but I never got the flushing and I am not sure if this is not just CIS symptoms that remained. I will get the monthly blood checkup and hope my values are all good to continue this medication. I just hope my CIS never develops into MS and this medication helps to prevent this.

He got weaker after each treatment, not knowing if it was the progression of the disease, the flare-up, or the medication. He was using a four-wheeled walker and falling. The day after his first half dose in January 2019, he was a bit stronger, and by spring, he was only using a cane.

So it was a bit of a mystery until 2022 when my left eye got stuck to the left a bit and is still off track and a problem. The ophthalmologist ordered an MRI of the brain and found a lesion. So back to the neuros, and after numerous MRIs since 1997 and visiting several different neuros, it was concluded after some discussions by a team of neuros that I have SPMS. Finally, a proper diagnosis and the mystery is somewhat over. Neuro said don't be hard on previous neuros and MRIs, as we have better knowledge, drugs, and better MRIs since 1997 (by the way, I thought it was due to damaging my neck sustained from dropping a heavy board on my head).

I got worse in every aspect. Now I fully understand wtf MS is, and Ocrevus was the driving force. I stopped taking it in 2020. I spent all of 2021 on nothing, as I now use a scooter and canâ€™t walk anymore. Iâ€™m trying to lower my EDS score through physical therapy so that I could be eligible for Mayzent. Oh how I wish Mayzent was my next move from Aubagio. Sadly, was not approved in 2018 in Canada.""",01/10,25,Ocrevus,5.2,Unmet needs,"[0.338454008102417, 0.17414221167564392, 0.12361794710159302, 0.09076949208974838, 0.086309514939785, 0.08577584475278854, 0.042341869324445724, 0.0360952727496624, 0.022493837401270866]",Adherence/patient switchouts,"[0.21607932448387146, 0.20952394604682922, 0.2044765055179596, 0.16520780324935913, 0.053504347801208496, 0.05183401703834534, 0.04379641264677048, 0.03661242127418518, 0.018965130671858788]",Unmet needs,"[0.18463489413261414, 0.15977069735527039, 0.14242152869701385, 0.13565027713775635, 0.12192417681217194, 0.07891923189163208, 0.06960152089595795, 0.058291807770729065, 0.048785872757434845]",Safety,"[0.13727732002735138, 0.1300542652606964, 0.12423387169837952, 0.1232338398694992, 0.12281186878681183, 0.10956569761037827, 0.09013000875711441, 0.08398360759019852, 0.07870953530073166]"

Nevertheless, brain MRIs show numerous lesions, and my quality of life has taken a substantial hit, resulting from severe fatigue, sexual dysfunction, an episode of severe depression and anxiety, which took almost a year to get under control and for which I'm still receiving treatment, etc. In a sense, I can say that the three MS therapies that I've been on have been equally effective because I have yet to experience a relapse while on any of them.

I had such high hopes when I read that not only did it do a great job in reducing relapses and new brain lesions, it significantly slowed progression and even dramatically improved a lot of patientsâ€™ symptoms. Well, in the almost two years Iâ€™ve been on it, all it has done for me is make my walking a heck of a lot worse. Prior to Ocrevus, I used to enjoy going on hiking trails even though I used a cane.

I researched a lot into Kesimpta and in August '23, I started on it. Initially, there were many side effects. Initial loading doses induced flu-like symptoms, which would fizzle out after a few days. After about three months, I was just getting headaches after injecting. Now, these did develop into migraines, which sometimes would last for weeks on end. However, after 6 months on it, the side effects settled and I can confidently predict what will happen. I jab, within three days I can get a bit of a migraine, and that lasts a day or two. Due to my job, I get an MRI every six months, and both my previous scans were stable with no symptoms. I feel very positive about Kesimpta now, after a tough enough start.

I almost fell while on the treadmill and had trouble walking around my house. I also had other new symptoms, which prompted an emergency brain MRI. My neuro said my body may have been adjusting to the med change, so I continued on the monthly injections to this day. Annual brain and spine MRIs this year showed no new lesions, atrophy, or black holes. The main symptom was extreme fatigue, usually the week before my next shot. It used to be a lot worse in that I would have to take that week off from working out, which is a big deal for me, as exercise is very important to me.

My PCP started me on an antihistamine and Mucinex. Had no positive results. Then I researched potential side effects of Kesimpta, finding nothing listed for Kesimpta and sinusitis. Then I researched Ofatumumab extensively. I did find that Azerra was the name of the Ofatumumab given for CLL (Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia). Found several sites indicating sinusitis was a common side effect of Azerra. One listing indicated saline nasal spray may be beneficial. I did try the saline nasal spray with extremely positive results. Finally, I am able to sleep without choking on the continuous nasal drainage that woke me up frequently at night.

I tried Ampyra for 6 weeks and decided to go off it today. It did not help walking or anything else. Further, I had gotten rid of the tingling and L'Hermitte's syndrome through a change in diet after I was diagnosed. Once I started Ampyra, both of those came back, as well as my menopausal hot flashes, which had subsided. In addition, with the Ampyra, it takes 1 1/2 hours to fall asleep even with prescription sleeping pills, and I also have back pain. I know 3 men who have been taking Ampyra for 7 years, and they swear by it, but it was a total bust for me.

My course has been largely benign: most of my symptoms involve sensory sensations on my right side; a few times those sensations have been pronounced enough that it causes weakness/numbness in my foot and some trouble walking. I haven't had a relapse for 8 years now; not sure if it's because I have mild MS or if it's the Copaxone. For now, I'm not willing to go off it to find out. Of all the MS drugs, I think Copaxone has the most manageable side effects. I've never had any problems aside from being a little sore after the injection and getting those lumps after repeated injections.

I was on Copaxone for 5 years and was doing great before the switch. Had I known what I know now, I would have opted for the alternative Copaxone financial assistance (a reimbursement program) to stay on the daily shot once Kaiser auto-switched patients to Glatopa (for cost-saving purposes to them) without ensuring the negative side effects to patients because basically they just don't care. All that being said, within 6 months of switching to Glatopa, I ended up in the hospital with transverse myelitis for 10 days (with a 100K hospital bill), which is more than a relapse, it's a completely new lesion on the spine. Anyway, while in the hospital, a doctor told me that a generic does not have to be exactly the same ingredients as their predecessor. She said the generic drug can contain up to 20% of new proprietary ingredients. Wish I had known. It's unbelievable that Kaiser (or any doctor) would just switch patients to a new drug without that full disclosure or before the medication has been truly tested as a genuine safe replacement. I have since been referred to the MS Center (where they don't recommend Glatopa - go figure). My new doctor (at the MS Center) put me on Tysabri - which I hear is the 'Cadillac' of current MS treatments. Anyway, been doing fine on it so far with the exception of lingering nerve discomfort from the Glatopa relapse (for which I also take Gabapentin).

I went to the ophthalmologist, who then referred me to the imaging center and then to the neurologist. The MRI showed only four MS lesions. The doctor put me on Aubagio. Seven milligrams for 30 days, then 14 milligrams thereafter. About the third week of the 7 milligram course, I did some light yard work, as up until that time I had no symptoms of MS except for my eye, which continues. After I did the yard work, I got really bad pain in my upper arms and shoulders, and my chest, like in my sternum.

My neuro switched me to Aubagio which I've been on for over 2 1/2 years. I did have hair thinning for the first 7 or 8 months but no other side effects and the thinning stopped. In fact, my hair has been growing in thicker and now has a bit of a wave to it. I don't know if it's the Aubagio or just coincidence but I've always had naturally straight baby fine hair. I have always taken my pill at night right before bed so maybe that helps with not having other side effects.

So, naturally, we were devastated again... since both our brains suck. He was on Copaxone for two years until he had a terrible relapse where he was totally paralyzed except for his right hand, and he had to be admitted into the hospital, go into rehab, and come home in a hospital bed. This was when he started Tysabri, July 2011. Since then, he slowly came back from being bedridden to being in a wheelchair for months, to using a walker for months, then using a cane. I believe Tysabri helped him come back to himself and his family, physically and mentally.

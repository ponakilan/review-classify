"Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) 							""Started on Plegridy. First titrating dose left me with awful flu-like symptoms for nearly 48 hours. Additionally, the autoinject pen is horribly designed. When I tried to take my second dose, it malfunctioned, stabbing me with the needle but failing to inject the medicine. Lovely. What was so hard with sticking to the standard “press autoinject on your skin and then press a button” mechanism? The Plegridy autoinject pen requires you to use a stabbing mechanism into your skin, with then it automatically releases the needle and injects the medicine. Or at least that’s what is supposed to happen. I find it far more mentally taxing than any other autoinject pen that I’ve used. I wish there was another option for injecting this medication. Also - the medicine comes implanted in the autoinject pen already, and you cannot remove the syringe, which means you have to put this bulky 1” x 1” x 9” pen into your sharps container for each dose you administer.

We have had 4 trips to the emergency room since then and are currently in the 4th week of rehab learning how to function again. She has lost all feeling in her left torso and leg, is numb on the right side of her face, and now has incontinence issues. She is suffering severe cognitive loss and will most likely not be able to return to her career. We were told that Lemtrada would not cure MS, but prevent any flare-ups. Had we known it would destroy her physically and mentally, we would never have agreed. Lemtrada has destroyed our lives. We would have been better off doing nothing. Supposedly, she is 1 of 3 cases that have had this reaction.""",Unmet needs,"[0.26308807730674744, 0.20310354232788086, 0.11205638945102692, 0.09704597294330597, 0.08189678937196732, 0.07599298655986786, 0.0691760778427124, 0.05706920474767685, 0.04057097062468529]"

She said the generic drug can contain up to 20% of new proprietary ingredients. Wish I had known. It's unbelievable that Kaiser (or any doctor) would just switch patients to a new drug without that full disclosure or before the medication has been truly tested as a genuine safe replacement.

My new doctor (at the MS Center) put me on Tysabri - which I hear is the 'Cadillac' of current MS treatments.

Since I have been on Rebif, I have not experienced any major relapses. Just some tremors now and then and other minor symptoms that may just be permanent nerve damage. I take the 44 mcg dose at bedtime with 400 mg of ibuprofen, it seems to help me sleep through the night. I do get headaches often, but the ibuprofen seems to help (not eliminate them).

"""I was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in 2006. I was nearly immediately put on Rebif. The worst reaction I have ever had are site reactions. I have learned to manage those by massaging the injection site before and after each injection. Ice helps if it is stinging after the injection, heat if it is aching. I had a pretty severe relapse in 2015, my new neuro put me on Tecfidera, which was awful. I would (exactly) 1 hour after taking the medication in the morning throw up for 1 hour (exactly), the flushing was miserable. I would flush so hard I would look nearly purple. I had so many physical issues, weight gain, etc. Not to mention I had low levels of JC virus and was still put on Tecfidera (that combination causes a brain infection).

"""This is a review from the caretaker side. My wife, Lori, had been diagnosed with MS since 1996. She had been on Betaseron till 2011 when she switched to Gilenya.

"We found out my husband has MS a year after I had brain surgery for removing 80% of an acoustic neuroma tumor. So, naturally, we were devastated again... since both our brains suck. He was on Copaxone for two years until he had a terrible relapse where he was totally paralyzed except for his right hand, and he had to be admitted into the hospital, go into rehab, and come home in a hospital bed. This was when he started Tysabri, July 2011. Since then, he slowly came back from being bedridden to being in a wheelchair for months, to using a walker for months, then using a cane. I believe Tysabri helped him come back to himself and his family, physically and mentally. He had another relapse two years ago, only because he stopped taking Tysabri for a month to get tested for his JC virus.

"This is my third treatment for RRMS. Having been on Brabio and Plegridy and having awful adverse side effects, I needed to radically change my MS management and treatment to something new. I researched a lot into Kesimpta and in August '23, I started on it. Initially, there were many side effects. Initial loading doses induced flu-like symptoms, which would fizzle out after a few days. After about three months, I was just getting headaches after injecting. Now, these did develop into migraines, which sometimes would last for weeks on end. However, after 6 months on it, the side effects settled and I can confidently predict what will happen. I jab, within three days I can get a bit of a migraine, and that lasts a day or two. Due to my job, I get an MRI every six months, and both my previous scans were stable with no symptoms. I feel very positive about Kesimpta now, after a tough enough start.

The increased risk of sunburn was surprising, and the constant scalp irritation, even with intense conditioning and hydration, has been baffling.

I see my neuro this week and will ask. I called the one-to-one nurse, and it was a total waste of time.

"""Well, from my experience with treatment with ocrelizumab I would prefer to have my relapses because at least in between them I had a bit of relief from symptoms. Now I don't get any relief.

I haven't had a relapse for 8 years now; not sure if it's because I have mild MS or if it's the Copaxone. For now, I'm not willing to go off it to find out.

"Glatopa (glatiramer) ""For what it's worth, I would not recommend switching to Glatopa yet (as it's still too new in the market). I was on Copaxone for 5 years and was doing great before the switch. Had I known what I know now, I would have opted for the alternative Copaxone financial assistance (a reimbursement program) to stay on the daily shot once Kaiser auto-switched patients to Glatopa (for cost-saving purposes to them) without ensuring the negative side effects to patients because basically they just don't care. All that being said, within 6 months of switching to Glatopa, I ended up in the hospital with transverse myelitis for 10 days (with a 100K hospital bill), which is more than a relapse, it's a completely new lesion on the spine. Anyway, while in the hospital, a doctor told me that a generic does not have to be exactly the same ingredients as their predecessor. She said the generic drug can contain up to 20% of new proprietary ingredients. Wish I had known. It's unbelievable that Kaiser (or any doctor) would just switch patients to a new drug without that full disclosure or before the medication has been truly tested as a genuine safe replacement. I have since been referred to the MS Center (where they don't recommend Glatopa - go figure). My new doctor (at the MS Center) put me on Tysabri - which I hear is the 'Cadillac' of current MS treatments. Anyway, been doing fine on it so far with the exception of lingering nerve discomfort from the Glatopa relapse (for which I also take Gabapentin).

Side effects were aches and flu-like symptoms the following day, which subsided with the following techniques: Day of injection, filling up on fluids. Two hours prior to injection, taking two ibuprofen. Injection in the buttocks rather than thigh-this made a big difference.

My hair has thinned, but I anticipated that side effect. I have a runny nose most of the time and still have some diarrhea. I've had 2 relapses, but they were only a few days in length. I am awaiting an MRI to determine if the Aubagio is working, so fingers crossed. I want to stay on it as Copaxone is the next option. My insurance doesn't cover Aubagio, but I qualified for a bridging program, so I am forever grateful.

What was so hard with sticking to the standard â€œpress autoinject on your skin and then press a buttonâ€ mechanism?

The only premeds I received were Pepcid, Tylenol, and Benadryl. I started feeling very nauseous early on, so they gave me something for nausea. After that, my heart rate was extremely high, and we couldnâ€™t get it to go down. They gave me something for anxiety hoping that would help, but my heart rate was still pretty high when they decided to stop the infusion. When I got home, I literally slept until the next day because I felt so terrible. I felt pretty crappy for the next few days or so. As a result, my doctor prescribed me additional premeds, and the next 2 infusions I had went perfect. I think premeds are key.

Per...,,"December 27, 2019","Well, from my experience with  treatment with ocrelizumab I would prefer to have my relapses because at least in between them I had a bit of relief from symptoms. Now I don't get any relief. It makes me constantly fatigued, it's given me extreme lower back pain and hip burning, my body feels like I've run a marathon when I walk so I'm on crutches, my right leg feels like it has an elastic band round my groin so the numbness is persistent. I have extreme confusion about everything and dizziness takes over so I must sit. It's changed my personality in a bad way; I'm constantly angry and frustrated, I go from being extremely depressed, anxious and crying about having to leave the house out of fear to the complete opposite which is laughing about anything and everything?? It makes me feel out of control of my body and I'm constantly in pain and I'm constantly exhausted. 
This is just everything I've experienced since starting this treatment. It could be different for you.",2 / 10,negative,"• Experienced constant fatigue

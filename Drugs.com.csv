Additionally, the autoinject pen is horribly designed. When I tried to take my second dose, it malfunctioned, stabbing me with the needle but failing to inject the medicine. Lovely. What was so hard with sticking to the standard “press autoinject on your skin and then press a button” mechanism? The Plegridy autoinject pen requires you to use a stabbing mechanism into your skin, with then it automatically releases the needle and injects the medicine. Or at least that’s what is supposed to happen. I find it far more mentally taxing than any other autoinject pen that I’ve used. I wish there was another option for injecting this medication. Also - the medicine comes implanted in the autoinject pen already, and you cannot remove the syringe, which means you have to put this bulky 1” x 1” x 9” pen into your sharps container for each dose you administer.

At that point, I really didn't care about the side effects. All I wanted was some semblance of my life back. As it turned out, Tysabri is and was a miracle drug.

Unfortunately, due to being on the medication for so long and coming back with a positive JC Virus test, I am being taken off the medication which scares me to death.

The side effects have been difficult to say the least. Terrible urinary tract infections, headaches, ringing of the ears, anxiety, and depression.

They want to have you on it until (if you're lucky) you test positive for the JC virus, and take you off ASAP. Otherwise, you'll go unnoticed and risk a brain infection, but it gets worse.

First reactions were pretty miserable. About six hours after my injection, I started shaking and was absolutely freezing. I had a mild fever, about 1Â°. I could not get warm, and I live in South Florida! The shaking stopped after a couple of hours and then I started getting really hot. I had a couple degree fever by then. And I was hot, hot, hot. By mid-afternoon the next day I felt 90% fine. The second injection was way better and I only got a mild fever and a headache. The third week was better still. A mild headache and about a half a degree fever. But now, during my off week, I have been feeling really tired and frequently mildly nauseous. I don't know what that means.

I got through the loading doses, the side effects were akin to having a short but very severe flu. I was prepared for that. I tend to feel like a normal person towards the next dose when enough time has passed. I like not having constant severe pain like I did on Copaxone. However, I wish that medical professionals would stop minimizing and undertreating the pain of this disease and how it can be further aggravated by taking DMDs. There are times on Copaxone and Kesimpta that I dread the myalgia resulting from the scheduled dose because I know the Aleve or Advil the doctor or nurse has emphatically declared will cure, won't fully help. The increased risk of sunburn was surprising, and the constant scalp irritation, even with intense conditioning and hydration, has been baffling.

Also, burning sensation in the leg muscles when getting up from a chair/bed. I have some cramps in my feet and lower legs. Calf muscles locking. Goes away when standing up.

My PCP started me on an antihistamine and Mucinex. Had no positive results. Then I researched potential side effects of Kesimpta, finding nothing listed for Kesimpta and sinusitis. Then I researched Ofatumumab extensively. I did find that Azerra was the name of the Ofatumumab given for CLL (Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia). Found several sites indicating sinusitis was a common side effect of Azerra. One listing indicated saline nasal spray may be beneficial. I did try the saline nasal spray with extremely positive results. Finally, I am able to sleep without choking on the continuous nasal drainage that woke me up frequently at night.

The injections are little more than a minor inconvenience. More importantly, I have remained stable with no attacks. I did experience some fatigue when starting to use the prefilled syringe.

Originally diagnosed with RRMS in 2016, then PPMS in 2019, my walking and balance had degraded to requiring a cane at all times. Further, my stamina became non-existent. During a drive to see family after my first two doses, I had to pull over to, ahem, answer the call of nature. I walked unaided down into and back out of a ditch. I thought only about watching my step. I didn't fall or falter. Later that evening, I walked nearly half a mile without stumbling or bracing myself once. I carried my cane, but did not use it. I do not know if my improvement will continue or if this is as far as I can go.

All that being said, within 6 months of switching to Glatopa, I ended up in the hospital with transverse myelitis for 10 days (with a 100K hospital bill), which is more than a relapse, it's a completely new lesion on the spine. Anyway, while in the hospital, a doctor told me that a generic does not have to be exactly the same ingredients as their predecessor. She said the generic drug can contain up to 20% of new proprietary ingredients. Wish I had known. It's unbelievable that Kaiser (or any doctor) would just switch patients to a new drug without that full disclosure or before the medication has been truly tested as a genuine safe replacement. I have since been referred to the MS Center (where they don't recommend Glatopa - go figure). My new doctor (at the MS Center) put me on Tysabri - which I hear is the 'Cadillac' of current MS treatments.

What was so hard with sticking to the standard â€œpress autoinject on your skin and then press a buttonâ€ mechanism? The Plegridy autoinject pen requires you to use a stabbing mechanism into your skin, with then it automatically releases the needle and injects the medicine. Or at least thatâ€™s what is supposed to happen. I find it far more mentally taxing than any other autoinject pen that Iâ€™ve used. I wish there was another option for injecting this medication. Also - the medicine comes implanted in the autoinject pen already, and you cannot remove the syringe, which means you have to put this bulky 1â€ x 1â€ x 9â€ pen into your sharps container for each dose you administer.

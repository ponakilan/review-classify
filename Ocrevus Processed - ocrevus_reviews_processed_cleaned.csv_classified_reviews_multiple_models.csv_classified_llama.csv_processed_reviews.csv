I had such high hopes when I read that not only did it do a great job in reducing relapses and new brain lesions, it significantly slowed progression and even dramatically improved a lot of patients’ symptoms. Well, in the almost two years I’ve been on it, all it has done for me is make my walking a heck of a lot worse. Prior to Ocrevus, I used to enjoy going on hiking trails even though I used a cane. Now I can barely hobble around my backyard. Rather than slowing down progression, it seems to have sped mine up. I fear that if I continue to stay on it, the day will come when I won’t be able to walk at all anymore.
